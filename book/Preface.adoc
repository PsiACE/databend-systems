In the vast landscape of database systems literature, numerous books have been written, 
exploring the intricacies of specific databases or providing comprehensive overviews of the field as a whole. 
However, the extension of database system architectures to the cloud has remained relatively uncharted territory. 
Despite ongoing discussions about cloud-native databases, there is a scarcity of books that delve into this domain.

In a thought-provoking article by Jamie Brandon footnote:[
A shallow survey of OLAP and HTAP query engines. https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/a-shallow-survey-of-olap-and-htap-query-engines .], it is mentioned:

The cloud databases are all pretty cagey about how they parallelize  queries. I couldn't figure out anything about Snowflake, Redshift or  SingleStore.

Enter Databend footnote:[Databend is a modern cloud data warehouse. https://github.com/datafuselabs/databend/], 
a cloud database that emerged in 2021, with a specific focus on the OLAP field and the ability to perform massive-scale analytics on object storages. 
Databend differentiates itself by providing open access to its source code and even launching its own cloud services footnote:[Databend Cloud. https://www.databend.com/]. 
Yet, as of now, there is no dedicated book introducing Databend and shedding light on its underlying philosophy.

Motivated by the need for objective and insightful content, I have taken it upon myself to write this book on cloud databases, with a primary emphasis on Databend. 
While I may not be an expert, I am committed to addressing any potential omissions to the best of my ability. 
I kindly request your assistance in identifying any areas that may require further attention and refinement.

Without further ado, let us embark on this journey together.

*P.S. 1.* _It is important to note that the content of this book has not undergone extensive review. Additionally, as a current member of Databend Labs, I ask for your understanding in reserving my praise for the appropriate time._

*P.S. 2.* _If you are interested in writing a foreword or providing a book review, I would be thrilled to hear from you. Please feel free to reach out to me._

Thank you for your support and encouragement.
